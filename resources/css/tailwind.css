/*
 This file is the Tailwind input for the Buni CMS core. During package
 installation the composer plugin will attempt to compile this into
 `public/vendor/cms/tailwind.css` using the application's `npx tailwindcss`
 tool. Themes may enqueue the compiled file via the `cms_enqueue_scripts`
 hook; core views reference the compiled asset instead of the CDN.
